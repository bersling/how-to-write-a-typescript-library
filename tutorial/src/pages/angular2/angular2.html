    <h2>How to write an Angular2 Library</h2>
    
    <p>
      Since AngularCLI nor any of the official Angular resources
      offer a straightforward way, I've composed my own tutorial on how to write an Angular2+ library.
      <b>Note: This tutorial describes how to publish typescript sources to npm. The library will only
        work for Angular2 projects written in typescript!</b> I don't compile to javascript
      plus d.ts files, because after hours of trying I was on the brink
      of throwing my notebook out the window, and I gave up. It was too annoying with rollup, umd,
      MyLibraryModule not found, index.ts names, long waiting times with "yarning" and "ng serving",
      inlining html and css, crazy tsconfig.json's with deprecated flags, no good local development environment, working version
      in local project but breaking when published and so on.
      But since a majority of the community uses typescript anyways and it's
      not my fault that it's so damn hard to publish a working library, I'm just going to publish typescript sources.
    </p>
    
    <h2><span class="step">Step 1:</span> Create a new project with the AngularCli</h2>
    <p>
      Create a new project. This will be a wrapper and consumer for your library module.
      I am going to call my library <code>libex</code> (for "library-example", and it was still free on npm)
      so I call the new project <code>libex-project</code>
    </p>
    <pre class="code-snippet">ng new libex-project</pre>
    
    <h3>Change prefix</h3>
    <p>In <code>libex-project/.angular-cli.json</code>
      change the <code>prefix</code> flag to whatever you like.
      In this example I'll choose <code>libex</code>.
      If you're using tslint, you'll also want to adjust this in the tslint.json
      under <code>component-selector</code> and <code>directive-selector</code>.
    </p>
    
    <h2><span class="step">Step 2:</span> Create a new module</h2>
    
    <p>
      Your library will reside in it's own module. But first we've got to create said module.
    </p>
    
    <pre class="code-snippet">ng g module libex</pre>
    
    <p>Then we <code>cd</code> into that folder.</p>
    
    <pre class="code-snippet"><code>cd src/app/libex/</code></pre>
    
    <h2><span class="step">Step 3:</span> Build your library module</h2>
    <p>Create components, services etc., e.g.</p>
    
    <pre class="code-snippet">ng g component hello</pre>
    
    <p>When you're done, you'll have to <strong>export</strong> the desired components:</p>
    
    <pre class="code-snippet">@NgModule({
  imports: [
    CommonModule
  ],
  declarations: [HelloComponent],
  exports: [HelloComponent]
})</pre>
    <p>You can use your <code>AppModule</code> to test the library:</p>
    <pre class="code-snippet"><code>...
imports: [
  BrowserModule,
  LibexModule
],</code></pre>
    <p>Note: If you need singleton services, you can modify your library module like so:</p>
    <pre class="code-snippet">@NgModule({
  providers: [ /* Don't add the services here */ ]
})
export class LibexModule {
  static forRoot() {
    return {
      ngModule: LibexModule,
      providers: [ SomeService ]
    }
  }
}</pre>
    <p>and change the imports in <code>AppModule</code> to:</p>
    <pre class="code-snippet"><code>...
imports: [
  BrowserModule,
  LibexModule.forRoot()
],</code></pre>
    
    <h2><span class="step">Step 4:</span> Publish</h2>
    
    <p>
      In your module folder, create a new <code>package.json</code>. You could do this with the <code>npm init</code>
      command. It should look somewhat like this:
    </p>
    
    <pre class="code-snippet">{
  "name": "libex",
  "version": "1.0.16",
  "description": "An Example Library.",
      ...
}
</pre>
    
    <p>
      Basically only the library name matters. Also rename <code>libex.module.ts</code> to <code>index.ts</code>
      since that's the standard name for a main file.
      Now since we're just publishing the typescript sources (note: that means your library will only work for
      consumers that <b>also</b> use typescript), we're ready to publish. Just run <code>npm publish</code>!
      You can also add a <code>.npmignore</code> so you publish only exactly what's needed, it works like .gitignore,
      just for npm.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And what's furthermore a good idea, is to re-export some files from index.ts. For example <code>export * from './hello.service'</code>,
      since then the consumer can just write <code>import { HelloService } from 'libex'</code> instead of
      <code>import { HelloService } from 'libex/hello.service'</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In case your library requires other libraries, you can also install them in your library module's folder and to
      the <code>package.json</code> we've just created. Just run <code>npm install --save something</code> from
      the library folder.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For subsequent releases, <code>npm version patch</code> (or <code>minor</code> or <code>major</code>) and then <code>npm publish</code>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Well and that's it, now you have your library, which you can develop & test locally
      and publish to npm!
    </p>
